# Pasalacabra (browser game)

Browser game inspired by the Spanish TV show "Pasapalabra": a ring of letters ("rosco"), questions read out loud, and quick controls for **Pasalacabra**, **Reveal**, **✓ / ✗**, multi-player handoff, timer, and phone camera background.

### Game screen
Accessed from either:
- **Daily game** (`Juego de hoy`): Single-player game using `set_01.json` with medium difficulty (4 minutes)
- **Custom game**: After setup, launches with your selected players, topics, and difficulty

Features:
- **Camera**: runs behind the ring (mobile-friendly). Top-right **📷 ⟲** flips between front/rear camera when available.
- **Timer**: big at the top. Each player has a **single time bank for the whole game** based on difficulty mode (paused while handing the phone).
  - **Difícil**: 3 minutes (180 seconds)
  - **Media**: 4 minutes (240 seconds) 
  - **Fácil**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Question reading**: questions are **spoken out loud** (no on-screen question text). On mobile, speech is triggered from the **Start** button to comply with browser gesture policies.
- **Question source**: 
  - Daily game: Uses predefined set (`set_01.json`)
  - Custom game: Uses topic-based generated questions or test mode sets

### Controls
- **Start**: starts/resumes the active player's turn (uses that player's remaining time).
- **Pasalacabra**:
  - **Single player**: passes to the next unresolved letter and continues the turn.
  - **Multi-player**: ends the turn and requires handoff.
  - After the first round (A-Z completed), can be used 1 second after question starts reading.
  - Plays the **goat** SFX.
- **Reveal**: shows the correct answer and reveals **✗ / ✓** buttons.
- **✗ / ✓**:
  - On **✓**: speaks **"Sí"**, then plays the correct SFX, then continues to next unresolved letter.
  - On **✗**: ends the turn immediately (stops timer), speaks **"No. La respuesta correcta es …"**, then plays the wrong SFX.
- **Siguiente: <nombre>**: appears when the turn ends. Rotates to the next player who still has time. If nobody has time, the game ends.

### Timer end behavior
- When a player's timer hits **0**, the game automatically **captures a snapshot** of their final game state (camera + letter ring with all correct/wrong/passed letters).
- If there are **multiple players**: when time hits **0**, it automatically rotates to the **next player with time left** (idle handoff).
- If **no players** have time left: the game shows the **winner** based on most correct answers (ties broken by fewer mistakes).
- If there is **only 1 player**: the game ends when their time hits **0**.

### End of game slideshow
- After the game ends, a **slideshow animation** automatically plays showing each player's snapshot.
- Each player's photo is displayed for 4 seconds with their name, score (✓ correct / ✗ wrong), and a **🏆 ¡Ganador!** badge for the winner(s).
- The slideshow loops continuously until manually closed.
- **Video recording**: The slideshow is automatically recorded at 30fps when it starts.
- A **💾 Download** button appears in the slideshow overlay to save the recorded video (`.webm` format) for sharing on social media.
- **📱 Share results** (single-player only): Share your game results in a Wordle-like emoji format. Displays a circular ring pattern (11x10 grid) with emojis representing correct (🟢), wrong (🔴), and skipped (🔵) letters, along with your score summary. Uses the Web Share API when available, or copies to clipboard as fallback.

## Data & architecture

### Question topics
Question files live in `src/questions/` with one file per topic:
- `astronomia.ts`, `biologia.ts`, `musica.ts`, `deporte.ts`, `ciencia.ts`, `cine.ts`, `historia.ts`, `geografia.ts`, `arte.ts`, `folklore.ts`, `cultura.ts`

The question bank is dynamically generated at game start based on selected topics, ensuring:
- Each player gets unique questions (no duplicates across players)
- Similar topic distribution per player

Note: The `cultura.ts` file provides questions for the "Cultura General" topic (mapped as `culturageneral` in the code).

### Question sets
Predefined question sets live in:
- `src/data/sets/set_01.json` … `src/data/sets/set_06.json`

Loaded via:
- `src/data/sets.ts` using Vite `import.meta.glob` (no `resolveJsonModule` needed).

**Daily Game** (`Juego de hoy`): Uses `set_01.json` for a quick single-player game with medium difficulty.

**Test Mode**: In the setup screen (staging only), enables using a fixed question set instead of topic-based questions.

JSON shape:
```json
{
  "id": "set_01",
  "title": "Optional title",
  "questions": [
    { "letter": "A", "question": "…", "answer": "…" }
  ]
}
```

### Daily set generation
The daily set can be generated with OpenAI and stored in `src/data/sets/set_01.json`.

Local run:
```bash
OPENAI_KEY=... python3 scripts/generate_daily_set.py
```

Rules enforced by the generator:
- Exactly one valid answer (no ambiguity)
- Answer is not contained in the question
- Letter constraint enforced ("Empieza por" / "Contiene la")
- Questions are drawn from 3 randomly selected topics:
  Astronomía, Biología, Música, Deporte, Ciencia, Cine, Historia, Geografía, Arte, Folklore, Cultura
- Mixed difficulty with at least 3 hard (university-level) questions
- Secondary AI validation pass verifies/fixes output

Workflow:
- Run **Generate Daily Set** manually in GitHub Actions.
- It creates a review branch named `tomorrow-YYYY-MM-DD` with the updated `set_01.json`.
- Merging that branch into `main` triggers the deploy workflow and rebuilds the Vite app.
Required secret: `OPENAI_KEY`.

### Engine scaffold (pure logic)
- `src/game/engine.ts` contains types + pure helpers for future refactors:
  - `Player`, `GameSession`
  - `PlayerState` (progress tracking)

## Audio on mobile (important)

Mobile browsers (especially iOS Safari) require **user gesture "unlocking"** for audio.
This app unlocks audio on the first tap and on key buttons, and uses **Web Audio** with prefetch + pre-decode for low latency.

## Using ngrok

If Vite blocks the host when using ngrok, add it to:
- `vite.config.ts` → `server.allowedHosts`

Example host from a previous run:
`erma-dogged-edmond.ngrok-free.dev`
